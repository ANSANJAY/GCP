title: Google Cloud VM Live Migration and Availability Policies
description: Understand Live Migration, On-Host Maintenance Options, and Automatic Restart Policies in GCP Compute Engine
---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Summary

1. **VMs run on physical host machines** managed by Google Cloud.
2. GCP performs **infrastructure maintenance** (hardware/software/network upgrades) on those hosts.
3. You can configure how VMs behave during maintenance using **Availability Policies**.
4. These settings apply only to **Standard VMs**, not to **Spot or Preemptible VMs**.
5. Two key options in Availability Policy:
   - **On-Host Maintenance**
     - `Migrate VM instance` (Recommended)
     - `Terminate VM instance`
   - **Automatic Restart**
     - If enabled, the VM restarts automatically after unexpected stops (e.g., host failure).
6. Live migration allows VMs to move **without downtime** across hosts within the **same zone**.
7. Even VMs with **local SSDs** are supported (except for those using GPUs).
8. These settings are configured when you create or update a VM instance under **Advanced > Availability Policy**.

---

## üõ† Real-World Use (with Your Project Experience)

> While managing CI/CD runners for SonarQube integration at AmEx, we used **Standard VMs** with **Live Migration** enabled. This ensured that GCP host-level maintenance didn't interrupt active PR scan jobs.
>
> - We configured **Automatic Restart = ON** to recover from underlying failures.
> - Our critical agents were set to `Migrate VM Instance`, allowing seamless transitions with no job failures.
> - This helped maintain system reliability and reduced operational overhead during weekly GCP maintenance windows.

---

## üéØ Interview Questions + Sample Answers

**Q1: What is live migration in GCP?**  
**A:** Live migration allows Google Compute Engine to move running VM instances between host machines during maintenance without shutting them down or restarting. It ensures zero downtime.

---

**Q2: Which VM types support live migration?**  
**A:** Live migration is supported for **Standard VMs** and **VMs with local SSDs**, but not for **Spot**, **Preemptible**, or **GPU-attached** instances.

---

**Q3: What are the options under On-Host Maintenance policy?**  
**A:** You can choose to either:
- `Migrate VM instance` ‚Äì live migration to another host (recommended)
- `Terminate VM instance` ‚Äì stops the VM during host maintenance

---

**Q4: What is the purpose of the Automatic Restart option?**  
**A:** It defines whether a VM should automatically restart if it is terminated due to non-user initiated reasons (like host failure). Enabling this ensures high availability.

---

## üß† Analogy to Remember

üß≥ **Hotel Guest Analogy**:
- You‚Äôre staying in a hotel (VM on a host).  
- If the hotel needs maintenance (GCP host maintenance), they **quietly move you to another room** (live migration) **without waking you up**.
- If your room is unavailable after the move (host failure), the system will **book you into another room automatically** (automatic restart).

---

## üîß CLI Command Summary

```bash
# Create a standard VM with live migration and auto restart
gcloud compute instances create live-mig-vm \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=e2-micro \
  --maintenance-policy=MIGRATE \
  --restart-on-failure \
  --provisioning-model=STANDARD

# View availability policy settings
gcloud compute instances describe live-mig-vm \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --format="get(scheduling.automaticRestart, scheduling.onHostMaintenance)"

title: Google Cloud Spot VMs & Preemptible VMs
description: Learn how to use Spot VMs and understand the differences from legacy Preemptible VMs in GCP. Optimize cost for fault-tolerant workloads.
---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Spot VMs** are temporary virtual machines that use GCP's **excess Compute Engine capacity**.
2. They offer a **60‚Äì91% discount** compared to standard VMs.
3. Spot VMs are **subject to preemption**‚ÄîGCP may stop or delete them **at any time** to reclaim resources.
4. **No automatic restart** or **live migration** support is available for Spot VMs.
5. You can configure **On VM Termination** action as:
   - `STOP` (default)
   - `DELETE`
6. You receive a **30-second warning** before a Spot VM is preempted.
7. **Shutdown scripts** can be added to gracefully handle preemption events.
8. **Use Spot VMs** for **fault-tolerant and cost-sensitive workloads**:
   - HPC
   - Big data analytics
   - CI/CD runners
   - Batch processing
   - GKE node pools
9. **Preemptible VMs** are an older version of Spot VMs:
   - Max runtime of **24 hours**
   - **No GPU or local SSD support**
   - Not recommended for new use cases

---

## üõ† Real-World Use (with Your Project Experience)

> During batch-based artifact verification at AmEx, we used **Spot VMs** to reduce infrastructure costs by up to **75%**.
> 
> - Jobs were checkpointed using GCS and Cloud SQL.
> - Spot VMs ran as **ephemeral CI/CD runners**, where interruptions were tolerable.
> - Preemption-aware shutdown scripts archived logs and uploaded partial data before deletion.
> - For fault-tolerant GKE clusters, **Spot node pools** helped auto-scale across zones.

## üéØ Interview Questions + Sample Answers

**Q1: What are Spot VMs in GCP?**  
**A:** Spot VMs are temporary virtual machines that run on GCP's unused capacity and are available at a discounted price. They can be preempted anytime if GCP needs the resources.

---

**Q2: How do Spot VMs compare to Preemptible VMs?**  
**A:** Spot VMs are a modern replacement for Preemptible VMs. Unlike Preemptible VMs, Spot VMs:
- Have no 24-hour limit
- Support GPUs and local SSDs
- Offer configurable termination behavior (Stop/Delete)

---

**Q3: What is the termination behavior of Spot VMs?**  
**A:** You can choose to:
- `STOP` the VM (default), allowing reuse when capacity is available
- `DELETE` the VM permanently

Both options receive a 30s warning before termination.

---

**Q4: Can I use free tier credits with Spot VMs?**  
**A:** No. Spot VMs are **excluded** from GCP's free tier credits. A **billing-enabled project** is required.

---

**Q5: What kind of workloads are best for Spot VMs?**  
**A:** Fault-tolerant and parallel workloads such as:
- Data processing jobs
- CI/CD runners
- ML training (checkpointed)
- GKE node pools with auto-healing

---

## üß† Analogy to Remember

üéüÔ∏è **Last-Minute Movie Ticket Analogy**:  
Spot VMs are like cheap last-minute movie tickets for empty seats. You get a great deal, but you could be asked to leave if the theater needs the seat back. They're perfect if you're flexible and don‚Äôt mind interruptions.
